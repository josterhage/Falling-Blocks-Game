# Falling-Blocks-Game
Clone of a fairly well known game involving falling blocks.

This was the first coding project of more than a few hundred lines that I actually completed. Looking back through it to remove possible copyright issues, I realized how obviously new I was at writing software. I'm going to rewrite this in the next few weeks/months to be more efficient and to generally follow OOP practices and techniques.
